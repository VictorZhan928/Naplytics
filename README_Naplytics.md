# Naplytics ðŸ’¤  
**Investigating the Impact of Napping on Productivity and Energy Levels**

## ðŸ“˜ Overview  
Naplytics is a data-driven study and simulation project designed to explore how a 15-minute midday nap affects workplace productivity and subjective energy levels in entry-level corporate employees. Through carefully structured simulations and statistical analyses, the project evaluates the feasibility of implementing nap policies in real-world organizational settings.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Quantify the productivity and energy level improvements after a 15-minute nap.
- Compare nap and no-nap groups using two key metrics:
  - **OSS (Occupational Self-Efficacy Scale)** â€“ for productivity.
  - **SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress Scale)** â€“ for energy levels.
- Provide recommendations to companies regarding nap policies based on simulated outcomes.

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodology  
- **Participants**: Simulated data based on 78 full-time employees across four major U.S. cities and multiple industries.
- **Groups**: Control group (no nap) vs Treatment group (15-min nap).
- **Metrics**:
  - OSS (scale of 0â€“100) to measure productivity.
  - SUDS (scale of 0â€“10) to assess subjective energy levels.
- **Statistical Tools**:
  - Two-sample *t-tests* for hypothesis testing.
  - Simulations for power analysis, confidence intervals, and effect size.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings  
- A 15-minute nap shows a **10-point average increase in OSS** and a **1.5-point increase in SUDS** in effect scenarios.
- Strong statistical evidence suggests productivity and energy levels benefit significantly from short naps.
- Visualizations and simulations confirm the potential effectiveness of structured nap programs.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies  
- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `kableExtra`  
- **Simulation Functions**: `simulate_productivity()`, `simulate_energy()`, `get_stats()`  
- **Visualization**: Power curves, histograms, and result tables.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Limitations  
- Simulation-based (not real-world data).
- Generalizability may be limited to office-based settings.
- Self-reporting bias remains a consideration for energy measurements.

---

## ðŸ§  Conclusion  
This study demonstrates the potential for **15-minute naps** to serve as an effective workplace intervention to improve cognitive performance and well-being. We recommend that organizations explore structured napping policies to boost workforce productivity and morale.
